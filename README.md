# Pac-Man Clone

This project ports the Pac-Man clone to a simple React application. A minimal development server is included so you can try it locally.

## Running Locally

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) if you don't already have it.
2. In this directory run:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. Open your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to play the game.

The server simply serves the files in this folder; no build step is required.
